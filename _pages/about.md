# About Me
I am a software engineer at Dell Technologies working on AI/ML solutions on storage. I am also a volunteery research engineer at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, working in VIS-Lab (Vision, Intelligence, and System Laboratory) led by Prof. Ziming Zhang focusing on deep learning and computer vision. 

I obtained Master of Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology (part-time) and Master of Data Science from University of Texas at Austin (part-time) during 2021-2025. I also obtained Master of Computer Science degree from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, before I joined Dell Technologies. Prior to that, I was a research assistant in the department of computing at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I obtained my first master degree in computer science from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and bachelor degree in computer science from Hohai University.

My research areas lie in computer vision and machine learning, especially in deep learning, medical image analysis, point cloud processing, IoT, and natural language processing. My works have appeared in ICCV, NeurIPS, IROS, ACM Computing Surveys. I serve as a reviewer for several conferences (e.g. ICLR, IJCAI, IJCNN, KDD, MIDL, CHIL) and journals (e.g. expert systems with applications, engineering applications of artificial intelligence).
